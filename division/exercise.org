## Practice problem 3.12

Consider the following function for computing the quotient and ramainder of two
unsigned 64-bit numbers:

#+begin_src C :tangle uremdiv.c
  void uremdiv(unsigned long x, unsigned log y,
               unsigned long *qp, unsigned long *rp) {
          unsigned long q = x/y;
          unsigned long r = x%y;
          *qp = q;
          *rp = r;
          }
#+end_src


Modify the assembly code shown for signed division to implement this function.
